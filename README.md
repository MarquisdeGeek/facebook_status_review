facebook_status_review
======================

A Javascript parser/processor to analyse your Facebook statuses WITHOUT abusing your privacy.

At this time of year, every seems to post status updates that condense their 
year of posts into a single line, or graphic. Unfortunately, every one that 
does it uses a Facebook app which (usually) makes a copy of all their (and 
sometimes your!) accessible data!

Since I don't want to give me data to these people... but I'm still curious 
about my year... I wrote this page to do a similar job. And it doesn't steal 
anything!

The process is:

* Go to your Facebook settings page
* Click on the 'Download a copy' link
* Wait for the archive to be built, and extract its contents
* Open the file html/wall.htm into a text editor, and copy+paste the contents 
  into the box below
* Click on one of the processing links below. The Javascript on the page will 
  process your update locally on your machine, so no data appears anywhere else!



Disclaimer: I wrote this for myself. It works on my timeline, in English. I haven't checked anything else. Also, the code is a hack and might not be updated with anyone's suggestioned - but I'm always happy to receive them at marquisdegeek@gmail dt com.
